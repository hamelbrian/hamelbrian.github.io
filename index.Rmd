  <p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles. I am supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. My research has been published in the *Journal of Politics*, *Political Behavior*, and *Legislative Studies Quarterly*, among others.</p>
  <p>I study American political behavior and institutions. My dissertation and primary research agenda focuses on the politics of government spending. Current projects examine how demographic, electoral, and legislative factors shape who receives government benefits, and how benefits affect political outcomes and behavior.</p>
  <p>Other research programs consider the influence of candidates, campaigns, and contexts on political opinion and behavior, and the effects of scandal and corruption in elections.</p>
