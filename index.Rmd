  <p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles. My research has been published in the *Journal of Politics*, *Political Behavior*, and *Legislative Studies Quarterly*, among others.</p>
  <p>I study American political behavior and institutions. My dissertation explores the fundmamental political question of "who gets what" from government, why, and how it matters. In a series of empirical papers, I link data on federal block grant allocations, New Deal-era economic relief spending, 311 city services, and hurricane disaster relief aid with election returns, voter registration files, and demographic data. Combined, I offer new evidence on the reciprocal relationship between policy and politics. Other research focuses on voter turnout, as well as candidate, campaign, and contextual effects on mass political behavior.</p>
  <p>I am on the academic job market in 2020-2021.</p>
