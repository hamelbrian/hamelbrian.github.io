  <p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles. My work has been supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and a UCLA Dissertation Year Fellowship, and has been published in the *Journal of Politics*, *Political Behavior*, and *Legislative Studies Quarterly*, among other outlets.</p>
  <p>I study American public policy. My dissertation, *The Power --- and Limits --- of the Purse*, includes four empirical papers exploring the fundamental political question of "who gets what" from government, why, and how it matters. Do politicians deliver government resources to political supporters, swing voters, or certain demographic and economic groups at the expense of others? Does receiving government aid increase political participation, and do voters reward and punish incumbent politicians at the ballot box for delivering or failing to deliver benefits? To address these questions, I draw on a variety of historical and contemporary data, including data on New Deal-era economic relief spending FEMA disaster relief aid recipients, 311-initiated requests for city goods and services, and city block grant spending. My findings offer new insights into democratic representation and accountability in the United States.</p>
  <p> Other research explores various topics in American politics, including the effects of political scandal and candidate characteristics (e.g., occupation) on elections.</p>
