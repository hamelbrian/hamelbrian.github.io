  <p>Welcome! Thank you for visiting my website.</p>
  <p>I am a Ph.D. Student in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles. I am supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. My primary research agenda focuses on class, inequality, and political behavior in the United States.</p>
  <p> My book-length dissertation project posits that work -- and the kind of work that you do -- is just as much a part of your identity as it is as source of material well-being. The book explores the individual-level consequences of involuntary and downward changes in work -- such as a move from a production job to a job in food services -- for political engagement and preferences. More broadly, the project seeks to reorient research on economic voting toward the nature of work and its role in our identities, and points to one way in which perceptions of status and social rank can affect how people think about the political world, and how they behave within it. Other projects examine mass and elite political behavior more generally, and have appeared in the *Journal of Politics*, *Political Behavior*, and *Political Research Quarterly*.</p>
  <p> I received a B.A. in Political Science from American University in 2016. I can be reached at bhamel@ucla.edu.</p>
